# Unified-Code
Searching for The fundamental codes that All human share.

I believe in a language that shared by all human. It may breakdown into a few sets of codes underlying the largest and the smallest scale Of the pure existence of all nature. 

I believe that it is also the most natural property of human which enables all of us unite and collaborate as one, effortless as breathing.

I'd like to start from the present bricks of our everyday life, in the light of the hidden wisdom in the law of all pure natural existence, try to decode some of the unified language.
